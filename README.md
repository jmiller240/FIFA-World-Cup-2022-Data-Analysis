# MAT 311-Data Science Final Project

This repo contains R code, data, visuals, and presentation slides for my MAT311 Data Science course (December 2022, Senior Year).
  
   
Question:
=============
The World Cup is currently in full gear, and my partner and I have both been watching closely. Given an abundance of data in sports these days, we're curious to analyze the success and failure of teams in the World Cup. What makes teams successful? Statistically, what factors separate the good teams from the bad ones? Which metrics are most predictive of a team advancing out of their group in the World Cup?


Goal:
=============
Find two or three statistics that meaningfully separate teams that advance from their group from those that don't. Hypothetically, we would want to be able to give this analysis to an international manager and have it be of use to them in their gameplan.


Data:
=============
From https://www.fbref.com, specifically their World Cup 2022 data tables. Found in the ./Data folder in this repo.


Results:
=============
Our final presentation can be found in PDF form in this repo, and resulting visuals are in the ./Visuals folder. Our final R code in Final.R
